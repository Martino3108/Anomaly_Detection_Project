# Anomaly Detection System

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of an **Anomaly Detection System** using advanced machine learning techniques. The project focuses on detecting anomalies in time-series data, with a particular emphasis on handling sequential data and identifying outliers in a variety of contexts. The system is designed to be easily extendable for different use cases and datasets.

## Features

- **Anomaly Detection**: The core of the project is an anomaly detection system that can detect abnormal patterns in time-series data.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Utilizes deep learning techniques, including LSTM Autoencoders, for detecting anomalies.
- **Customizable Pipelines**: The project includes pre-built pipelines for training and evaluating anomaly detection models with options to adjust hyperparameters.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

- **Anomaly_Detection_Code.ipynb**: The main Jupyter notebook where the anomaly detection models are trained, evaluated, and tested.
- **requirements.txt**: List of Python packages required for the project.
- **README** 
- **Dataset.xlsx/**: The dataset used in this project.
